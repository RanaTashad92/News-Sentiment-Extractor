The goal of this project was to build a Python-Based tool that scrapes online news articles and analyzes their sentiment (positive, negative). Using the BeautifulSoup library, the system will extract article titles and content from speciffic news source e.g GEO NEWS, THE DAWN ETC.
Then, it will use a sentiment analysis model such as TextBlob to evaluate the sentiment of each article.
